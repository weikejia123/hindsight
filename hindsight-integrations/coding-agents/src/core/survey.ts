/**
 * Codebase survey (Option C): on a cold repo, `session-start.ts` (hook harnesses) or
 * `runtime.ts`'s `seedIfCold` (opencode) spawns a DETACHED headless coding agent alongside the
 * git-history backfill (core/seed.ts) to explore the repo's structure and ingest what it finds as
 * memories, via the `hindsight_ingest_document` MCP tool (core/knowledge-tools.ts).
 *
 * A Hindsight knowledge page's body is synthesized server-side from the bank's MEMORIES via its
 * `source_query` — it can't be authored directly. So this survey doesn't write pages itself; it
 * ingests structural findings as documents, and the existing pages (missions.ts PAGES) synthesize
 * from them on the next consolidation, same as git history and chat transcripts do.
 *
 * **Harness-portable.** The survey used to hardcode headless `claude`, so a Codex/Antigravity/opencode
 * user without the `claude` binary silently lost the survey (the git-log seed still ran). It now
 * builds a per-agent headless recipe and runs the survey under **the current harness's own CLI**
 * (falling back to any other available agent), so whichever agent you use can seed its own repo:
 *   - claude : `claude -p … --mcp-config <inline> --disallowedTools …`   (inline MCP, self-contained)
 *   - codex  : `codex exec --sandbox read-only -c mcp_servers.hindsight…` (inline MCP, self-contained)
 *   - antigravity : `agy -p … --mode=plan --cwd <repo>` (read-only planning mode; MCP from the
 *                  global Antigravity customization config)
 *   - opencode: `opencode run --agent hindsight-survey …` (a read-only agent OUR plugin defines —
 *               see SURVEY_AGENT; tools from the loaded plugin, which under HINDSIGHT_DISABLE_HOOKS
 *               registers tools but skips seed/recall/write-back)
 * Each is read-only sandboxed (prompt-injection safety, since the survey reads untrusted repo files)
 * and spawned with HINDSIGHT_DISABLE_HOOKS=1 so the survey's own session doesn't re-fire our hooks.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget and fail-safe throughout, mirroring core/seed.ts's `startBackgroundSeed`: a
 * missing binary or a spawn failure must silently no-op, never crash the caller.

 * … ANY file edits, modifications, or system changes … This ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT overrides ALL other

 * to call hindsight_ingest_document, which reads as a "system change", so completion came down to
 * how literally a model took the reminder: #3450 saw the seed stall on ~half their repos, the agent
 * asking for permission that plan mode cannot grant. Prompt wording cannot win that argument — the
 * reminder claims to override all other instructions.
 *
 * The ruleset is also a TIGHTER boundary than plan's: opencode drops denied tools from the tool
 * list entirely, so the session is offered exactly read/grep/glob plus the one ingest tool — no
 * write, no bash, and no `task` (plan left all three reachable, and `task` reaches a subagent that
 * CAN write). Verified against opencode 1.18.9.
