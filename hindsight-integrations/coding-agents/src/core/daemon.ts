/**
 * Local daemon mode — memory with no server and no Cloud account.
 *
 * `serverMode: "daemon"` runs `hindsight-embed` on this machine and points the plugin at it.
 * Lifecycle is delegated to `@vectorize-io/hindsight-all`, which owns the uvx invocation, profile
 * creation, readiness polling and the macOS Metal/MPS workaround. This module only decides WHEN to
 * start it, and with what environment.
 *
 * Three connection modes, resolved in this order (the same priority the old per-agent Claude Code
 * plugin used in `scripts/lib/daemon.py`):
 *   1. an external API — Cloud or self-hosted; `serverMode` is not "daemon" and nothing here runs
 *   2. a healthy server already on the port — adopted as-is, never restarted, so a daemon started
 *      by an earlier session (or a server the user runs themselves) is reused
 *   3. start the daemon
 *
 * TIMING IS THE CONSTRAINT. A cold start pays for a uvx download plus model load and can take tens
 * of seconds, while the prompt hook has to return in time to not stall the user's turn. Only two
 * points therefore ensure a daemon: SessionStart, before the user has typed anything, and the Stop
 * hook, which has the longest budget and nothing waiting on its result. The prompt path does
 * nothing here at all.
 *
 * EVERY HARNESS NEEDS BOTH POINTS, not just the fresh-process hook ones. The persistent-plugin
 * hosts (opencode, Kilo, Cline, Prime Agent, dsh) run no hook binaries, so they reach these through
 * `RuntimeCore`: `seedIfCold` is their SessionStart and the write-back is their Stop. Missing that
 * is what #3524 reported — dsh in daemon mode never started a daemon, so every `hindsight_*` call
 * failed with ECONNREFUSED until the user ran `daemon-start.js` by hand. `daemon.test.ts` now fails
 * if a harness entrypoint builds a client without reaching one of the two.
 *
 * A daemon that is down is NOT special-cased anywhere downstream. Once the URL is resolved, every
 * mode uses the identical client and the identical error handling: an unreachable local daemon
 * surfaces as the same connection failure (and the same `retain_failed` diagnostic) as an
 * unreachable Cloud or self-hosted server. Skipping work because a local port was closed would have
 * made daemon mode behave differently from the other two for no benefit.
 *
 * There is no stop. One daemon serves every agent and repo on the machine, so ending one session
 * must not cut memory out from under another. Nothing retires it either, unless the user sets
 * `daemonIdleTimeout` — see daemonEnv.
