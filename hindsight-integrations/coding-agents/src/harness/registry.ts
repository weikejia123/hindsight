/**
 * Harness registry. Add a coding agent by implementing HarnessAdapter (one file in this dir) and

 *
 * getHarness() never statically OR dynamically imports opencode.ts, even for "opencode": backfill
 * (its only real caller — see core/config.ts's note that the top-level `harness` key just selects
 * the backfill session formatter) only ever needs a harness's chatReader, and every harness's
 * chatReader — opencode included — is the same normalized-JSON reader (jsonChatReader below).
 * opencode.ts's plugin-specific createRuntime (the only part that needs @opencode-ai/plugin) is
 * wired up directly by src/index.ts, the opencode plugin entrypoint, bypassing this registry
 * entirely. That keeps this file, and everything bundled from it (in particular backfill.js), free
 * of the @opencode-ai/plugin dependency.
