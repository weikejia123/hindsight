"""Reproduces the concurrent-insert deadlock on ``graph_maintenance_queue``
that PR #2353 targets, and demonstrates that a shared insertion order cures it.

Also covers the ``entity_cooccurrences`` deadlock between the Pass 2/3 sweep
(``prune_stale_cooccurrences``) and retain's concurrent cooccurrence upserts —
the dominant ``DeadlockDetectedError`` cause in production logs (39 of 41
occurrences in one week) — and the ``retry_with_backoff`` fix around that
sweep in ``run_graph_maintenance_job``.

A deadlock is a *database*-level phenomenon, so unlike the PR's own tests (which
only assert that the Python list handed to ``conn.execute`` is sorted) these run
against the real Postgres test DB and drive two genuinely-concurrent
transactions, forcing the exact interleaving that produces a lock cycle.

Modelling note
--------------
Production enqueues a whole victim set in ONE statement::

    INSERT INTO graph_maintenance_queue (bank_id, unit_id)
    SELECT $1, v FROM unnest($2::uuid[]) ON CONFLICT (bank_id, unit_id) DO NOTHING

That single statement still takes the per-row unique-key locks one row at a time,
in the order ``unnest`` yields — we just can't pause *inside* a single statement.
So each worker here issues the rows one at a time with a barrier between them.
That makes the otherwise-racy interleaving deterministic while exercising the
identical lock: ``ON CONFLICT`` on the ``(bank_id, unit_id)`` primary key.
