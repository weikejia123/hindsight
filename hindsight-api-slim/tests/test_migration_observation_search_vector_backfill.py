"""Regression for the consolidator search_vector gap (PR #2425).

Observations written by the consolidator under the ``native`` text-search
backend landed with a NULL ``search_vector`` and were invisible to BM25. The
writer is fixed to populate the tsvector; migration
``c3f7a1b9d2e4`` backfills the historical NULL observations.

This test seeds an observation with a NULL ``search_vector`` at the revision
just before the backfill, runs the migration to head, and asserts the row is
populated with a valid tsvector — and that already-populated rows are left
untouched. Uses a dedicated pg0 instance (mirrors test_migration_backsweep) so
it controls exactly which migrations have run and never stamps the shared test
instance.
