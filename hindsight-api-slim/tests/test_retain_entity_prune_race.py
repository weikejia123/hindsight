"""Regression coverage for the retain Phase-1 / orphan-prune FK race (#2662).

Between Phase-1 entity resolution (a separate, already-committed connection) and
the Phase-2 ``unit_entities`` insert, ``prune_orphan_entities`` can delete a
just-resolved parent that has no ``unit_entities`` row yet. The Phase-2 FK insert
then fails and the whole batch is dropped as non-retryable — silent memory loss.

The fix reasserts the resolved parents on the Phase-2 connection immediately
before linking: existing rows are locked so the pruner blocks, and rows already
pruned are re-created with their stored canonical name.
