"""Regression test: list_banks must consult the per-bank capability with the
*current row's* bank id, and source fact_count from the store when that bank
keeps its memories outside SQL.

Bug (introduced with per-bank store capabilities, #3350): list_banks called
``_store.writes_memory_rows_in_sql_for(bank_id)`` with a bare ``bank_id`` name
that is not in scope inside the per-row loop (the row's id is ``row["bank_id"]``).
Because the argument is evaluated before the call, this raised
``NameError: name 'bank_id' is not defined`` for *every* org on the very first
bank — i.e. GET /banks 500'd outright — regardless of the store's capability.

This test swaps in a store that reports ``writes_memory_rows_in_sql_for -> False``
(the non-SQL branch the feature added), and asserts list_banks (a) does not raise,
(b) calls the capability + count_memories with the correct per-bank id, and
(c) surfaces the store's live count as fact_count.

Runs via: uv run pytest tests/test_list_banks_non_sql_store.py -v
