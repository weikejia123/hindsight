"""Consolidation engine for automatic observation creation from memories.

The consolidation engine runs as a background job after retain operations complete.
It processes new memories and either:
- Creates new observations from novel facts
- Updates existing observations when new evidence supports/contradicts/refines them

Observations are stored in memory_units with fact_type='observation' and include:
- proof_count: Number of supporting memories
- source_memory_ids: Array of memory UUIDs that contribute to this observation
- history: JSONB tracking changes over time

NOTE: Observations are distinct from mental models (pinned reflections).
- Observations: auto-generated bottom-up by this engine from raw facts (memory_units table, fact_type='observation')
- Mental models: user-defined queries stored in the mental_models table, refreshed on demand via reflect

    Plain ``asyncio.gather`` re-raises the first exception immediately but does
    NOT cancel its siblings — they keep running detached. In consolidation that
    is actively harmful: the failure propagates out of ``run_consolidation_job``
    to the worker, which marks the operation failed and re-queues it with a 5s
    base backoff, while the orphaned tag groups are still calling the LLM,
    stamping ``mark_consolidated`` and committing write-groups. The per-scope
    ``scope_locks`` are local to one dispatch, so nothing serialises an orphan
    against the retry, and the "batches within a group run serially" invariant
    that keeps two consolidators out of the same observation scope is broken
    exactly when it matters.

    So: cancel the outstanding tasks and await them before propagating. A
    cancelled batch's writes stay invisible (its witness row is never
    committed) and are resolved by the recovery sweep, which is the same state
    a crash would leave.

    Deliberately not ``asyncio.TaskGroup``: it wraps failures in an
    ``ExceptionGroup``, and the worker's ``_is_non_retryable_task_error`` does
    ``isinstance`` checks on the raised exception — a wrapped
