"""
SuperGrok subscription LLM provider (``xai-oauth``).

Serves Hindsight's LLM lanes from a flat-rate consumer SuperGrok subscription
authenticated by a user-consented device-code OAuth grant — no API key, no
per-token metering — joining the engine's existing subscription-provider
category (``claude-code``, ``openai-codex``, ``nous``). For API-key access to
the same endpoint, use ``provider: openai`` with an ``api.x.ai`` base URL; the
credential is what this provider adds, not the endpoint.

What it talks to
----------------
``https://api.x.ai/v1``, xAI's published API, spoken plainly: an
``Authorization: Bearer`` header carrying the OAuth access token, the standard
content headers, and the cache-affinity hint below. No client-identity or
version headers are sent.

Why not ``OpenAICompatibleLLM``
-------------------------------
The wire format is OpenAI-shaped, but the credential is a rotating OAuth token
with proactive/reactive refresh against a shared on-disk store, and xAI's 403
responses need their own classification (a spending-limit stop is not a
credential failure). Neither fits the OpenAI SDK client the compatible provider
is built on, so the transport is a hand-written ``httpx.AsyncClient`` in the
``codex_llm`` mould.

Logging
-------
Bodies, credentials, and header values are never logged by default: byte
counts, the model name, status codes and durations only. The one gated
exception is ``HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_DEBUG_HEADERS`` (default off), which
logs a small allowlist of non-credential response headers (``via``,
``x-request-id``, ``cf-ray``, ``server``, ``date``) on a non-2xx reply only,
for diagnosing an otherwise untraceable upstream failure. It never fires on a
2xx reply, never logs the request's own headers (which carry the bearer
token), and never logs a body.
