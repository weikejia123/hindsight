# dateparser.search_dates over-matches: short common words that happen to be
# weekday/month abbreviations in *some* language ("we"/"me"/"did" -> a weekday,
# "do" -> Sunday) come back as bogus dates. When such a false positive appears
# *before* the real date in the query, taking the first match (or a hard-coded
# blacklist of such words) silently produces a wrong temporal window — worse
# than none, because the constraint is non-null so nothing downstream can tell
# extraction failed. See issue #2768.
#
# Instead of blacklisting words one at a time (a moving target — every short
# word dateparser resolves is a new instance of the same bug), we score each
# match by the date signal it actually carries and keep only matches with a
# real signal, preferring the strongest. A bare weekday abbreviation carries no
# day/month/year and scores zero, so it is rejected regardless of language or
# dateparser version.
