    Phase 1: ANN search for semantic neighbors among existing units.

    Runs on a separate connection OUTSIDE the write transaction to avoid
    holding locks during expensive HNSW index probes. Uses a temp table +
    LATERAL join to batch all probes in a single query.

    Queries are split by fact_type so PostgreSQL uses the per-bank partial
    HNSW indexes (idx_mu_emb_worl_*, idx_mu_emb_expr_*). Without the
    fact_type filter, the planner falls back to sequential scan (~50x slower).

    """Recreate archived causal edges whose endpoints are both live again.

    Counterpart of :func:`snapshot_causal_links`, called when a fact reverts to
    ``valid``. Descriptors whose peer is still archived (or was permanently
    deleted) are silently dropped from this insert: the bulk writer only takes
    links whose endpoints exist in ``memory_units``. That is the point — a
    still-archived peer keeps its own copy of the descriptor and materializes
    the edge when *it* reverts.

    Insertion is ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``, so repeated invalidate/revert
    cycles never duplicate an edge.

    Args:
        stored_descriptors: The archive row's ``causal_links`` payload, already
            decoded from JSON. Entries that don't parse as a causal edge are
            skipped (see :meth:`CausalLinkDescriptor.from_json_dict`).

    Returns:
        Number of descriptors submitted (not all of which may materialize).
