    index the base text columns directly and keep only a dummy column, so there is

    The ``*_col`` arguments are the SQL for each text source (a column name or a

    ``mental_models`` (name + content). Pass ``native_inline=False`` when the

        # It used to be a correlated subquery — COUNT(DISTINCT s) over

        # re-scanned the connected-source array linearly for every element of every
        # candidate's array. Because consolidation appends to source_memory_ids and
        # never prunes it (issue #1725), that product grows with the bank's age: at
        # 5k observations averaging 113 sources against ~3k connected sources it was
        # ~1.7B element comparisons, 2.6s of one saturated backend (issue #3085).

        # the number of source ids instead.
        #
        # `connected_sources` caps each entity with row_number() rather than the
        # LATERAL + LIMIT that reads more naturally. Do not "simplify" it back
        # (issue #3510). The scoring join above is O(C + U) when planned as a hash
        # join and O(U x C) when planned as a nested loop — 15s and ~15M rejected
        # rows on a realistically-shaped bank — and PostgreSQL picks between them
        # from its row estimate for this CTE. Out of a LATERAL + LIMIT subquery the
        # capped column carries no n_distinct statistic, so DISTINCT over it was
        # estimated at 2 and the NOT EXISTS took that to 1 against an actual ~3,700;
        # a 1-row inner side makes the nested loop look free, so it won on cost and
        # lost by four orders of magnitude at runtime. Ranking with a window keeps
        # the column traceable to unit_entities.unit_id, so the estimate comes from
        # real statistics (207-3,449 against 2,242-4,193 actual) and the nested loop
        # is priced honestly.
        #
        # The trade is that this reads every unit_entities row of a matched entity
        # to rank it, where the LATERAL stopped at per_entity_limit off the index:
        # O(sum of degree) rather than O(entities x per_entity_limit). Measured at
