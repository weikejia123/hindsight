"""Background maintenance loop.

A single periodic loop that drives all of Hindsight's recurring housekeeping
from one place, so we don't spawn a separate ``asyncio`` task per concern:

- **Retention sweeps** (configurable, default hourly): delete ``audit_log`` and
  ``llm_requests`` rows older than their configured retention, across *all*
  tenant schemas.
- **Consolidation reconcile** (configurable, default 5 min): re-schedule
  consolidation for banks that have eligible-but-unscheduled facts and no
  in-flight consolidation. This recovers facts that were stranded when a
  consolidation operation failed terminally and left them with
  ``consolidated_at IS NULL AND consolidation_failed_at IS NULL`` and nothing to
  re-trigger them.
- **Scheduled mental model refresh** (configurable check cadence, default 5 min):
  refresh mental models whose ``trigger.refresh_cron`` schedule is due, but only
  when the model is stale (new memories in its scope since its last refresh), so
  a scheduled tick never burns an LLM call to regenerate identical content. The
  per-model schedule lives in the cron expression; this loop only decides when to
  *check*.

The loop wakes on a short fixed tick and runs each job when its own
``last_run + interval`` is due (run-at-start, then on interval), so adding jobs
with different cadences doesn't burst CPU. Cross-tenant discovery goes through
server-side PL/pgSQL routines (``schemas_with_expired_rows`` and
``banks_needing_consolidation``, in the configured schema — see ``fq_routine``) —
one round-trip each — instead of a per-schema query storm, which matters at
thousands of tenants.

The loop runs in *every* API/worker process with no leader election, so a job that
enqueues work must make that enqueue idempotent or the fleet queues one wave per
process. Operation cleanup deletes a bounded batch per schema; the consolidation
reconcile and the scheduled mental model refresh both dedupe against in-flight
operations inside the inserting transaction (see ``_submit_async_operation``);
retention deletes in bounded chunks claimed with SKIP LOCKED, so concurrent
sweepers split the work instead of colliding (see ``_purge_table_in_batches``).

The *work* is therefore safe to run everywhere. The *discovery* in front of it is
not free: one round-trip on the wire is still one query per tenant schema inside
the routine, every process pays it, and its cost scales with tenant count while
the work it finds does not. Two things keep that proportionate, and both are
load-bearing rather than incidental:

- **Cadence is config, not a constant.** Every job's interval is a server-level
  setting. The jobs that delete rows whose retention is measured in *days*
  (retention, operation cleanup) have no reason to probe every schema every
  minute.
- **The first tick is jittered** (``maintenance_start_jitter_seconds``). Every job
  is due on the first tick, so a fleet started together — a deploy, a rolling
  restart — would fire every cross-tenant probe in every process at the same
  instant. SKIP LOCKED keeps that correct but not cheap: the probes are reads, and
  N of them land at once. Steady state self-staggers; startup does not.

# Retention used to issue one unbounded `DELETE FROM <table> WHERE started_at <
# cutoff` per schema. On a table with a real backlog that is a single statement
# holding row locks for minutes while it reads the whole expired range — and the
# maintenance loop runs in every API/worker process with no leader election, so
# every pod issued it at the same hourly boundary. Observed as two concurrent
# 330s+ deletes pinned on IO.DataFileRead, blocking each other on row locks,
# saturating RDS I/O and tripling recall latency.
#
# The fix is to design the collision out rather than elect one sweeper: each chunk
# claims its rows with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, so concurrent sweepers take
# *disjoint* chunks instead of waiting on each other, and the total work stays the
# number of expired rows however many pods join in. Chunks are short, index-driven
# transactions with a pause between them, so no statement holds locks for long and
# the deletes never monopolise disk I/O.
