        A batch_retain parent is a status *aggregator*: it carries no
        task_payload (workers never claim it) and is normally promoted to a
        terminal state by ``_maybe_update_parent_operation`` when its last child
        sub-batch finishes. Two crash windows can strand a parent 'pending'
        forever:

          * every child reached a terminal state but the promotion was skipped
            (the aggregation swallows and logs errors rather than failing the
            child, so a transient error there leaves the parent behind), or
          * the children never committed at all, leaving a parent with zero
            children (older non-atomic create paths, a hard kill mid-submission).

        Either way the parent sits 'pending' with ``task_payload IS NULL``: it is
        unclaimable, never counted in ``failed_operations``, unretryable via the
        API, and its documents are silently absent. See issue #2985.

        On worker startup we reconcile every such parent:

          * children present, all terminal -> completed / failed (mirrors the
            aggregator, inheriting a representative child error on failure),
          * no children at all -> failed, with an explicit reason so an operator
            can see the loss and resubmit the source documents.

        Parents with at least one still-live child are left untouched — the
        normal aggregation path will finish them once their children drain.

        Returns the number of parents driven to a terminal state.
