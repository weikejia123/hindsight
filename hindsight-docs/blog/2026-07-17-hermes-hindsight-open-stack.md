![The fully open agent memory stack: an open-weights model, an open agent, and open memory, all self-hosted](/img/blog/hermes-hindsight-open-stack.png)

Most "AI agent with long-term memory" setups have at least one part you cannot host yourself. The model is a frontier API behind a paywall, or the memory is a proprietary service that stores your agent's history on someone else's servers, or both. You can move the wrapper code to your infrastructure, but the two things that actually see all your data, the model and the memory, stay in the cloud.

Hermes plus Hindsight is the exception. The model weights are open, the agent is open source, and the memory system is open source. Every layer can run on your own hardware, and in the default configuration the memory layer makes no external network calls at all. This post is the grounded, layer-by-layer version of that claim: what is actually open, under which license, and how the pieces wire together into a stack you fully own.

<!-- truncate -->

## TL;DR

- **The model:** any open-weights model you can serve locally with Ollama, vLLM, or llama.cpp. We recommend `gpt-oss-20b`, OpenAI's Apache-2.0 open model: 128K context, native tool calling, about 13 GB, and the top model on our own retain leaderboard.
- **The agent:** [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is MIT-licensed and model-agnostic. It talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it drives your local model with no code changes.
- **The memory:** [Hindsight](https://vectorize.io/hindsight) is MIT-licensed. Self-host it with Docker or pip. Embeddings and reranking run locally by default, and the same local model can do its extraction, so a self-hosted server needs no external calls and no API key.
- **It fits a laptop:** the whole stack runs on an M3 Max (36 GB). In my test, retain took about 8 seconds and recall under a second. Numbers below.
- **The honest caveats:** the model needs at least 64K context (raise Ollama's default), automatic recall/retain needs a recent Hermes Agent build, and a self-hostable open model will not match a frontier API model on the hardest tasks. Details below.

## Why "fully open" is rare

Agent memory is the part of the stack with the most sensitive data. It is a durable record of everything your agent has seen: conversations, decisions, code, customer details. That is exactly the data you least want to hand to a third-party service you cannot inspect or host.

The common stacks do hand it over. A closed model means every prompt, including the memories injected into it, goes to an external API. A proprietary memory service means your agent's entire history lives in someone else's database. "Open" often means only the glue code is open while the model and the memory, the two components that see everything, are not.

A fully open stack closes both gaps. Here are the three layers.

## Layer 1: the model (open weights, your choice)

Because the agent in Layer 2 is model-agnostic, the model is the one part of this stack you get to choose. The only hard requirements are that it is open-weights (so you can run it yourself), has at least 64K of context, and supports tool calling, since memory operations are tool calls.

Our recommendation is **`gpt-oss-20b`**, OpenAI's open-weight model. It is a good default for concrete reasons: Apache 2.0 license, a 128K context window, native function calling, and small enough to run comfortably on a laptop (about 13 GB in a 4-bit Ollama build). It is also, as it happens, the top-ranked model on Hindsight's own retain leaderboard, which matters for Layer 3 below.

A word on the "just grab a trendy model" instinct, because it hides a trap. Take a small-sounding Kimi model. The genuinely current Kimi releases are 1-trillion-parameter-plus mixture-of-experts models that no laptop can hold. The one that looks small, Kimi-Linear-48B-A3B, advertises 3B "active" parameters, but you still have to keep all 48B weights resident: its 4-bit build is roughly 28 to 30 GB on disk and needs about that much RAM, which leaves no room for the memory system on a 36 GB machine, and its tool-calling support is undocumented. Active parameters are not the number that decides whether a model fits. Total weights are.

If you want more headroom than gpt-oss-20b, Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B (about 19 GB, 256K context, Apache 2.0, native tools) is a strong step up that still fits a 36 GB machine. And if you want a model from the same team that builds the agent, Nous Research publishes the open-weight Hermes family too. But for a local stack that just works, gpt-oss-20b is the pick.

## Layer 2: the agent (open source, model-agnostic)

[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is Nous Research's agent framework, and it is MIT-licensed. Importantly, it is *not* tied to the Hermes model. It is model-agnostic: you point it at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint and switch models with `hermes model`, no code changes.

That is what lets the open model and the open agent meet. Serve your chosen model locally and point the agent's `base_url` at it. Using the Ollama build of gpt-oss-20b, in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  default: gpt-oss:20b
  provider: custom
  base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1   # your local Ollama server
  context_length: 64000
```

The other local backends use the same pattern with a different port: vLLM on `8000`, llama.cpp's server on `8080`, LM Studio on `1234`. Two practical notes worth knowing before you start:

- **Context length:** Hermes Agent requires a model with at least **64,000 tokens** of context and rejects smaller ones at startup. gpt-oss-20b supports 128K, but Ollama defaults to a much smaller window, so set `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536` (or higher) or the check will fail. This is the single most common local-model snag.
- **Tool calling:** Ollama serves gpt-oss-20b with tool calling built in. If you use the raw servers instead, vLLM needs `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes` and llama.cpp's server needs `--jinja`. Memory operations are tool calls, so this matters.

At this point you have an open agent driving an open model, entirely on your machine. What is missing is memory: by default the agent is stateless across sessions, or it uses a built-in memory tool that just writes local markdown files. That is the third layer.

## Layer 3: the memory (open source, local by default)

Hindsight is MIT-licensed, and the whole thing self-hosts. The important part for a "fully open" claim is not just the license, it is that a self-hosted Hindsight server can run with **no external dependencies and no external calls**.

Start a server with Docker:

```bash
docker run -it --pull always --name hindsight --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8888:8888 -p 9999:9999 \
  -v hindsight-data:/home/hindsight/.pg0 \
  ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest
```

Or with pip, pointed at the same local model you are already running for the agent:

```bash
pip install hindsight-api
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
hindsight-api          # serves http://localhost:8888
```

The API comes up on `localhost:8888`, and a local server has **no authentication by default**, so it needs no API key.

Where does the data live, and what talks to the outside world? By default, nothing does:

- **Database:** Hindsight ships with an embedded PostgreSQL ("pg0"), so there is no separate database to run. Point it at your own PostgreSQL 14+ with a vector extension for production, or keep the embedded one for a local stack. On Windows, the embedded database means no Docker and no WSL.
- **Embeddings:** the default provider is `local` (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`), computed in-process. No embeddings API.
- **Reranking:** the default reranker is also `local` (a cross-encoder model). No rerank API.
- **The LLM:** Hindsight uses an LLM to extract facts on `retain` and to reason on `reflect`. This can be local too. Point it at your Ollama endpoint as above, or set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp` to run built-in inference with no external server (it auto-downloads a small GGUF on first run). `recall` itself, the search path, is just local embeddings and reranking, so retrieval never needs an LLM at all.

So the memory layer is genuinely local: local database, local embeddings, local reranking, and a local extraction model. Nothing about storing or recalling a memory has to leave your network.

### Which model should Hindsight use?

The model matters here, and it does not have to be the same size a chatbot needs. Hindsight only calls the LLM for `retain` (extracting facts) and `reflect` (reasoning across them); `recall` is pure local search. Because extraction is a structured, well-scoped task, small models do very well and a frontier model is overkill.

We publish a [model leaderboard](https://benchmarks.hindsight.vectorize.io/) that ranks LLMs specifically on retain and reflect, scored on quality, speed, and cost, so you can pick with data instead of vibes. `gpt-oss-20b` currently tops the retain ranking. That is convenient: the same model you are already serving for the agent is also the best-scoring extraction model, so **one 13 GB model powers the whole stack**.

## Wiring it together

Hermes has a pluggable memory-provider system. The built-in provider writes markdown files; Hindsight is a selectable provider you turn on with one setting.

```bash
hermes config set memory.provider hindsight
```

Then tell Hermes where your self-hosted server is, in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
HINDSIGHT_API_URL=http://localhost:8888
# No HINDSIGHT_API_KEY needed for a local server with auth disabled
```

Once the provider is active, Hermes uses Hindsight three ways:

- **Auto-recall:** on every turn, before the model is called, Hermes queries Hindsight for relevant memories and injects them into the system prompt (a `pre_llm_call` hook).
- **Auto-retain:** after each response, it retains the exchange to Hindsight (a `post_llm_call` hook).
- **Explicit tools:** `hindsight_recall`, `hindsight_retain`, and `hindsight_reflect` are available to the model for direct control.

You can pick the balance with the memory mode: `hybrid` (auto injection plus tools), `context` (auto injection only), or `tools` (tools only, no injection).

One version caveat to flag, because it is easy to miss: the automatic recall and retain hooks require a recent Hermes Agent build (the ones that added the `pre_llm_call` and `post_llm_call` hooks). On older versions the three explicit tools still register, but the automatic injection is silently skipped. If auto-memory does not seem to fire, update Hermes first.

There is also an even simpler path if you do not want to run a separate server: the Hindsight provider has a `local` mode that starts an embedded Hindsight with a built-in database automatically. It is the fastest way to try the stack. Running your own server on `localhost:8888` is the better choice when you want one memory store shared across several agents or machines, or full control over the extraction LLM.

## What the finished stack looks like

Put together, every box in the diagram is open and on your hardware:

| Layer | Component | License | Runs where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model | gpt-oss-20b (recommended) | Apache 2.0 | Ollama / vLLM / llama.cpp, local |
| Agent | Hermes Agent | MIT | your machine |
| Memory | Hindsight | MIT | your machine (embedded DB, local embeddings) |

No frontier API model. No proprietary memory service. No required external network call in the memory path. The agent reasons with an open model, and it remembers with open memory, and both the reasoning and the remembering happen on infrastructure you control.

## Does it fit on a laptop? I ran it on an M3 Max

All of the above is testable, so I ran it on a MacBook Pro (M3 Max, 36 GB) to see whether the claims hold. They do.

I served gpt-oss-20b through Ollama, then started a self-hosted Hindsight with the fully-local defaults, embedded PostgreSQL, local embeddings, local reranker, pointed at that same model for extraction:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
hindsight-api
```

The server reported healthy in about six seconds. Embeddings and reranking loaded onto the Mac's GPU (MPS), and the embedded database started itself. Then a retain and a recall from the CLI:

- **retain** of a two-fact sentence took about **8 seconds** on the first call, which includes loading gpt-oss-20b into memory. Hindsight correctly split it into two separate facts and resolved the entity.
- **recall** returned both facts, ranked, in about **0.6 seconds**. Recall does not call the LLM, so it stays fast on subsequent queries.

Resource-wise, the model is the only heavy part: roughly 13 GB on disk and a similar amount of RAM while loaded, which leaves comfortable headroom on a 36 GB machine. The local embedding and reranker models are a few hundred megabytes combined, and the embedded database is small. No API keys, and nothing left the laptop.

That is the whole exercise in one line: an open model, an open agent, and open memory, all on one laptop, with the memory layer making no external calls.

## When this actually matters (and when it does not)

Being able to self-host the whole stack is not free. You provide the GPU for the model, you run the server, and an open model at a size you can host may not match a frontier API model on the hardest tasks. So be honest about when the fully-open stack earns its keep:

- **Air-gapped or regulated environments** where data cannot leave your network. This is the case where a closed model or a memory SaaS is simply disqualified, and the open stack is the only option.
- **Data residency and privacy** requirements where "the vendor promises not to look" is not good enough, and you need the memory of your agent to physically stay on your systems.
- **No per-token cost and no lock-in.** Local inference has no metered API bill, and because both the agent and the model are swappable, you are not tied to any one provider.

If none of those apply, a hosted model and Hindsight Cloud will be less operational work, and that is a perfectly good choice. The point is not that everyone should self-host everything. The point is that with Hermes and Hindsight, you *can* self-host everything, including the two layers that see all your data, and very few agent-memory stacks let you do that.
