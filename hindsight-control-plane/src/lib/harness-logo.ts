/**
 * Which coding agent wrote a document, resolved to a logo.
 *
 * The convention is set by the writers, not by this UI. `hindsight-coding-agents`
 * stamps the harness on every document it retains, twice:
 *
 *   document_metadata.harness = "claude-code"      (the authoritative field)
 *   tags                      = ["harness:claude-code", ...]   (so it's filterable)
 *
 * Metadata wins over the tag: the tag is a projection of it and can be edited by
 * hand in the UI.
 *
 * The ids below are exactly the ones that integration emits — see its
 * `src/harness/hook-lifecycle.ts` (one HookSpec per hook-driven agent) and
 * `src/harness/registry.ts` (the persistent-plugin agents, whose id is the
 * `createPluginEntry(...)` argument of their entrypoint). Do not add entries for
 * agents that cannot appear yet: an id nothing writes is a logo nothing renders.
 * When that integration gains a harness, add it here in the same change — drop
 * its icon in `public/img/harness/` (copied from
 * `hindsight-docs/static/img/icons/`, or taken from the agent's own brand assets
 * when the docs site carries none; the docs site and the control plane are
 * separate packages and cannot share a static dir) and add one entry.
 *
 * An unknown harness is not an error: it renders no logo, and the value still
 * shows as an ordinary metadata chip.
