#
# Compatibility gate: hermes-agent @ main + the Hindsight stack in THIS checkout.
#
# Why this exists (see #3251):
#
# Hermes exact-pins every direct dependency (`==X.Y.Z`) as a deliberate
# supply-chain policy — they will not loosen a pin to accommodate us. Hindsight
# is installed *into Hermes' own venv* by `hermes memory setup` in
# `local_embedded` mode (the wizard installs `hindsight-all`), so any version
# range we declare that excludes one of their pins makes the pair impossible to
# co-install. #3251 was exactly that: our `cryptography>=48.0.1` / `pillow>=12.3.0`
# floors against their `==46.0.7` / `==12.2.0`, leaving `pip check` permanently
# broken for every Hermes user on embedded memory.
#
# That class of breakage is structural and recurring — both sides bump on their
# own schedule — so it needs a build gate, not a one-off fix. This script tracks
# Hermes' *main* branch rather than a PyPI release so the conflict surfaces here
# while it is still cheap to fix, instead of in a released Hermes.
#
# What it verifies, in order of increasing depth:
#   1. Resolution   — Hermes @ main and this checkout's Hindsight co-resolve.
#   2. pip check    — the resulting environment is internally consistent.
#   3. Wiring       — `hermes memory status` sees Hindsight in local_embedded mode.
#   4. Runtime      — the modules Hermes imports for embedded memory import cleanly.
#   5. Embedded     — the daemon actually boots under Hermes' pinned dependency
#                     set and serves bank operations.
#
# Step 5 boots a real embedded daemon (pg0 + local embedding models), which is
# the only way to prove the co-installed dependency set can actually *run*
# Hindsight rather than merely import it. The daemon refuses to construct a
# MemoryEngine without an LLM key, so it boots on a placeholder one — nothing
# calls the LLM during startup or bank operations.
#
# A retain/recall round-trip does need a working LLM, so that part runs only
# when HERMES_COMPAT_LLM_API_KEY is set (with HERMES_COMPAT_LLM_PROVIDER /
# _MODEL selecting the backend). Without a key all five steps still run — only
# the round-trip is skipped, and the script says so.
#
# Usage: scripts/test-hermes-compat.sh [--keep] [--hermes-ref BRANCH_OR_TAG]
#
#   --keep         leave the temporary work dir in place for inspection
#   --hermes-ref   Hermes branch or tag to test against (default: main). A bare
#                  commit SHA will not work — the clone is --depth 1.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Resolution — the #3251 gate
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything goes into ONE resolution on purpose. Installing Hermes first and
# Hindsight second would let the second install silently downgrade a Hermes pin
# and report success; resolved together, an unsatisfiable pin is a hard error.
#
# The Hindsight distributions are built into wheels from this checkout and
# installed from those, so the gate tests the branch under review.
#
# Wheels, NOT `file://` directory requirements: uv installs a workspace member
# given as a directory in a way that leaves `hindsight_embed.__file__` pointing
# back at the source tree. The embedded daemon manager keys dev-mode detection on
# that path (`__file__/../../../hindsight-api-slim`), so a directory install makes
# it launch the API via `uv run --project <repo>/hindsight-api-slim` — i.e. out of
# the *monorepo's* venv, with the monorepo's dependency set and .env, completely
# bypassing the Hermes venv this script exists to test. Wheels land in
# site-packages, dev mode stays off, and step 5 exercises the real thing. The
# assertion in step 5 keeps it that way.
#
# Hermes must be a *source clone + editable* install: its build backend raises
# "Building wheels or sdists for hermes-agent is not supported" on purpose, so a
# plain `git+https://...` requirement fails at the wheel-build step. Editable is
# the path their own docs point developers at. It also puts the repo's
# `plugins/` tree on sys.path, which is where the Hindsight memory plugin lives.
